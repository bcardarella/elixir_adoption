# Elixir Adoption Strategy Proposal

## Executive Summary

Elixir faces a critical challenge in growing its adoption beyond senior developers who have already experienced the problems it solves. While the technology offers significant advantages in concurrency, fault tolerance, and scalability, current messaging is factual rather than aspirational, and outreach efforts remain largely confined to the existing community echo chamber.

This proposal establishes an Elixir Adoption Group—a volunteer-run, advisory body tasked with coordinating comprehensive adoption and marketing initiatives. The Adoption Group will operate without enforcement authority, working exclusively with willing participants across the Elixir ecosystem to execute strategic initiatives in conference outreach, education, corporate engagement, and community development.

**Key Goals:**
- Expand Elixir's reach beyond its current echo chamber into competitive technology spaces
- Develop aspirational messaging that resonates emotionally with developers who haven't yet experienced the problems Elixir solves
- Improve the optics and presentation of Elixir projects to compete for attention in a crowded market
- Build systematic pathways for adoption, retention, and community growth
- Win over at least one FAANG or Fortune 500 company within five years

**Core Principle:** The Adoption Group makes recommendations and provides support but holds no power to enforce decisions. Project owners, conference organizers, and community members maintain full autonomy.

2. **Facilitate Connections**: Coordinate between core team members, library authors, speakers, and organizers
3. **Provide Resources**: Secure funding for travel, logistics, and materials; develop reusable content and messaging
4. **Gather Intelligence**: Conduct annual surveys, retention postmortems, and competitive analysis
5. **Package Success Stories**: Interview willing companies, create case studies, distribute across multiple channels
6. **Define Metrics**: Establish KPIs and conduct annual evaluations of strategy effectiveness

### Governance and Structure

**Staffing:** Initially volunteer-run with potential for paid positions as funding grows

**Decision-Making:** To be defined during formation phase after proposal approval

**Authority:** Advisory only—all recommendations require acceptance from autonomous participants

**Funding:** Operates through EEF/Elixir Foundation with targeted fundraising and defined budgets

**Review Cycle:** Annual evaluation of effectiveness and strategy adjustments

### Scope Boundaries

**What the Adoption Group Does NOT Do:**
- Enforce decisions on project owners or conference organizers
- Develop Elixir language features or improve developer tooling (Core team responsibility)
- Manage official documentation (Core team responsibility)
- Provide ongoing community management or member support
- Track conference-specific success metrics (conference responsibility)
- Build libraries to fill ecosystem gaps (community responsibility)
- Overcome corporate competitive/legal barriers to sharing success stories

## Strategic Initiatives

### 1. External Conference Outreach

**Objective:** Present Elixir at high-impact conferences outside the typical Elixir echo chamber to reach new audiences where they gather.

**Strategy:**
- Target conferences in competitive spaces: ReactConf for LiveView, Python ML conferences for Nx, Embedded C conferences for Nerves
- Position talks to address known weak points of competing technologies without being aggressive
- Lead with Elixir's strengths, acknowledge limitations honestly when relevant
- Focus on winning over the persuadable majority rather than arguing with every skeptic

**Speaker Tiers:**
- **Tier 1 - Key Speakers:** José Valim (Elixir core), Chris McCord (Phoenix/LiveView) reserved for highest-impact conferences
- **Tier 2 - Champions:** Selected community members coordinating with core team on presentation content
- **Tier 3 - Community Leaders:** Knowledgeable enthusiasts for regional and local events

**Target Frequencies:**
- Elixir, Phoenix, LiveView: 1 talk per quarter (distributed across speaker tiers)
- Nerves, Nx: 2 talks per year (distributed across speaker tiers)

**Support Provided:**
- 100% travel and logistics funding for Adoption Group-requested appearances
- Reusable slide decks developed once, updated based on feedback and technology evolution
- Core team technical review and content validation for Champions

**Implementation:**
- Adoption Group identifies high-impact conferences based on defined criteria
- Adoption Group requests key speakers or Champions to submit/present
- No expectation of fulfillment—all participation is voluntary with proper compensation and support

### 2. Elixir Champions Program

**Objective:** Develop a tier of qualified community speakers who can represent Elixir at conferences when key speakers are unavailable or for lower-tier events.

**Structure:**
- Selected from applicant pool based on demonstrated presentation skills and project work
- One-year terms with reapplication process
- Can be reselected based on performance and track record
- Coordinate with Elixir and Phoenix core team members on content development (case-by-case basis)

**Benefits:**
- Prevents over-reliance on small group of core maintainers
- Distributes speaking load across motivated community members
- Creates pathway for community leadership development
- Built-in quality control through term limits and reselection

**Support Provided:**
- Travel and logistics funding for approved conference appearances
- Access to core team for technical review and guidance
- Reusable slide deck templates and messaging materials

### 3. ElixirConf Optimization

**Objective:** Maximize the success and attendance of ElixirConf as the flagship community event to demonstrate ecosystem health and vibrancy.

**Current Challenges:**
- Summer timing conflicts with family commitments
- East Coast location bias while EU conference is now established
- Limited promotional reach (only Slack and Twitter)
- Late ticket sales and schedule publication
- High ticket prices may limit accessibility

**Recommendations:**
- **Timing:** Move from summer to early November, late February, or April
- **Location:** Consider mid-west United States (e.g., Salt Lake City with large Elixir presence) to attract SF/West Coast attendees
- **Ticket Sales:** Launch minimum 6 months in advance
- **Schedule:** Publish minimum 1.5 months before conference
- **Pricing:** Reduce workshop tickets to ≤$300, attendee tickets to ≤$500
- **Promotion:** Expand beyond Slack/Twitter to Reddit (30K), Discord (18.5K), Facebook (2.5K), LinkedIn, podcasts, newsletters, Dev.to, Hacker News
- **2025 Goal:** 500 attendees (up from <300 in 2024)

**Speaker Compensation Model:**
- Keynote speakers: Standard compensation, costs covered
- Regular speakers: Can opt into ticket-sales incentive program
  - Speakers receive unique ticket code
  - Tiered rewards: X tickets = room comp, X more = flight comp, X more = revenue share
  - Quality control through future selection and reputation impact
  - Keynotes can opt in but have costs covered regardless

**Note:** ElixirConf operates independently as an LLC. Adoption Group provides recommendations only—conference organizers have full autonomy to accept or reject suggestions.

### 4. Educational Workshops

**Objective:** Create regular opportunities for new developers to learn Elixir, increasing the pipeline of potential adopters.

**Target Frequency:** Once per quarter minimum

**Topics:** Entry-level content on Elixir fundamentals, Phoenix, LiveView, Nerves, Nx

**Key Challenge:** Making Elixir approachable for junior developers who haven't experienced the problems it solves

Compared to other languages, Elixir requires understanding not just syntax but an entire application design philosophy (OTP, supervision trees, process-based architecture). Developers coming from other languages who don't embrace this philosophy often fail to see Elixir's benefits and view the learning curve as unnecessary complexity.

**Strategic Questions for Adoption Group:**
- How to teach OTP concepts to developers who haven't hit scaling/reliability walls yet
- Whether to start with just syntax/FP or teach the philosophy from day one
- How to create aspirational messaging that says "you will encounter these problems"
- Finding the balance between accessibility and avoiding creation of developers who don't embrace the philosophy

**Delivery:** Remote or in-person, coordinated by Adoption Group but delivered by willing community educators

### 5. Direct Corporate Outreach

**Objective:** Establish Elixir adoption within large enterprise organizations through relationship building and education.

**Target Audience:** FAANG companies and Fortune 500 organizations

**Approach:**
- Offer internal technology talks on foundational Elixir topics to engineering teams
- Long-term relationship building: ongoing conversations, understanding pain points, addressing adoption blockers
- Patient, consultative approach recognizing enterprise sales cycles

**Five-Year Goal:** Win over one FAANG or Fortune 500 company

This goal is intentionally conservative. Even a single team or division within these massive organizations using Elixir represents significant success given their scale and influence on the broader industry.

**Timeline Rationale:** Enterprise adoption at this scale requires extensive back-and-forth, internal champion development, waiting for the right project opportunity, and addressing company-specific concerns. Five years is a realistic horizon for this process.

### 6. Retention and Postmortem Analysis

**Objective:** Understand why companies and individuals stop using Elixir to identify addressable issues.

**Process:**
- When Adoption Group learns (through word-of-mouth) that a company has moved away from Elixir, reach out to request a postmortem conversation
- Participation is entirely opt-in—companies have no obligation to respond
- Identify: reasons for leaving, what Elixir lost out to, addressable gaps or concerns

**Key Questions:**
- Are we speaking past people by assuming OTP understanding?
- Are our concepts too abstract for developers without relevant experience?
- What practical barriers (library gaps, tooling, hiring) drove the decision?
- Was the complexity-to-benefit ratio not justified for their use case?

**Application:** Feed findings into messaging adjustments, library gap identification, and strategic priorities

**Note:** For individuals, apply similar analysis—what prevents attracting larger numbers of developers and what causes them to abandon Elixir early in adoption process

### 7. Library Ecosystem Gap Analysis

**Objective:** Identify missing libraries and difficult-to-use existing libraries that prevent Elixir adoption.

**Process:**
- Gather data from annual survey, retention postmortems, community feedback
- Document gaps and pain points
- Report findings publicly to community

**Community Responsibility:** The Adoption Group reports gaps—community members decide if they want to build solutions

**Important Principle:** The Adoption Group will not build demand for libraries whose authors are unwilling to evangelize their own work. Library authors must be self-motivated and invested in their projects. The Adoption Group can provide support (conference opportunities, travel funding, marketing assistance) but will not carry water for unmotivated maintainers.

**Design Emphasis:** Modern, beautiful website design matters. Elixir is behind on visual presentation and modern aesthetic. Many potential adopters are lost at the top of the funnel due to ugly or outdated-looking sites. Elixir and Phoenix should set the tone for the ecosystem.

### 8. Meetup Revival and Support

**Objective:** Revitalize local and regional meetups as grassroots feeders for community growth and conference attendance.

**Current Challenge:** Many meetups are dormant, "squatted" by organizers who are no longer active

**Approach:**
- Reach out to inactive organizers with simple check-in: "Are you still interested in running this meetup?"
- If not, explore transfer of ownership or addition of co-organizer
- Help find new organizers from local community
- Empower active organizers to develop their communities

**Support Provided:**
- Monthly content updates: ecosystem news, trends, messaging guidance
- Reusable slide decks on latest Elixir changes that can supplement local talks
- Collaboration venue for meetup organizers to share success stories and best practices
- Low-cost, build-once-distribute-many model

**Strategic Importance:** Meetups are the "secret weapon" for grassroots open source growth. Local communities feed into regional conferences, which feed into national conferences like ElixirConf. They are essential infrastructure.

### 9. Tech Influencer Coordination

**Objective:** Increase Elixir visibility and reach through podcasts, YouTube, Twitch, and tech influencer channels.

**Strategy:**
- Coordinate appearances by José, Chris, and other Elixir leaders on popular tech podcasts and channels
- Only pitch with explicit knowledge, acceptance, and approval from speakers on where they're being pitched
- Connect Elixir influencers with interesting guests from core team and Champions

**Critical Production Quality:**
- Optics matter: video quality, audio quality, presentation matter
- We are in a competition for attention—poor AV quality loses audience before they hear the content
- Adoption Group provides guidance on affordable equipment and settings for quality production
- Influencers responsible for their own equipment—this is enabling through knowledge-sharing, not direct funding

**Support for Elixir Influencers:**
- Coordinate with growing group of Elixir content creators
- Enable them to grow their audiences through connections and support
- Influencers should stand on their own—not direct financial support

### 10. Case Study Development and Distribution

**Objective:** Capture and amplify success stories from companies using Elixir to provide social proof and practical evidence of value.

**Current Challenge:** Cultural disconnect—many companies using Elixir don't publicly talk about it. Lack of incentive or willingness to share.

**Strategy for Willing Companies:**
- Adoption Group conducts interviews and packages case studies
- Multi-channel distribution:
  - Elixir-lang.org website
  - White papers for enterprise audiences
  - Submissions to industry publications
  - Targeted sharing to markets where outcomes would be most impactful

**Constraints:**
- Only work with willing participants—cannot overcome competitive/legal barriers
- If companies won't share due to business concerns, that's outside Adoption Group scope
- Potential for anonymized/generalized case studies if attribution isn't possible (to be evaluated)

**Strategic Importance:** There is massive disconnect between companies hiring in Elixir and developers who even know those companies use Elixir. Case studies bridge this visibility gap.

### 11. Annual Community Survey

**Objective:** Establish baseline metrics and track year-over-year progress against KPIs.

**Current Gap:** No consistent, owned community survey exists to measure ecosystem health and adoption trends

**Adoption Group Responsibility:**
- Design and administer annual survey
- Define KPIs to track (to be determined by Adoption Group):
  - Potential areas: adoption rates, library ecosystem growth, community size, developer satisfaction, corporate usage, retention indicators
- Analyze trends year-over-year
- Use data to inform strategic priorities and measure initiative effectiveness

**Uses:**
- Strategic planning and priority setting
- Library gap identification
- Retention issue discovery
- PR/marketing material about ecosystem growth
- Evidence for fundraising and sponsorship efforts

### 12. Competitive Analysis and Differentiation

**Objective:** Identify and articulate Elixir's order-of-magnitude advantages in specific use cases to justify adoption costs.

**Core Principle:** For companies to switch from deeply embedded technologies, Elixir cannot be merely "better"—it must be dramatically better. Marginal improvements don't justify rewrite costs. Significant, order-of-magnitude benefits do.

**Strategy:**
- Conduct competitive analysis across major language ecosystems
- Identify where each is weakest against Elixir's strengths
- Create focused, one-dimensional comparison write-ups highlighting specific contrasts
- Don't position Elixir as always the best solution—identify specific use cases where it provides transformational value

**Potential Differentiators:**
- Concurrency and scalability vs. Node.js
- Real-time capabilities vs. React/traditional web stacks
- Fault tolerance and self-healing systems (Supervisor pattern) vs. most ecosystems
- ML performance characteristics vs. Python
- Embedded systems capabilities vs. C

**Diverse Value Propositions:** Different audiences need different benefits. Someone may not need scalability but could benefit tremendously from fault tolerance. Cast a wider net by addressing diverse pain points rather than positioning Elixir as only a scalability solution.

**Responsibility:** Adoption Group writes comparison content with technical validation from core team where needed

**Distribution:** Multi-channel sharing focusing on markets where each specific comparison is most relevant

### 13. Creative and Hobbyist Community Development

**Objective:** Attract developers motivated by exploration and creativity rather than enterprise ROI.

**Current Gap:** Elixir's focus on enterprise use cases and serious problem-solving misses the "weirdos"—people who want to build fun, creative projects with no purpose beyond enjoyment.

**Strategy:**
- Showcase weird, fun, non-commercial Elixir projects
- Demonstrate unique capabilities through experimental work
- Communicate to hobbyists, tinkerers, and creatives the cool things people are doing with Elixir
- Emphasize projects that would only be feasible or capable with Elixir's unique properties

**Strategic Importance:** Ecosystem growth cannot be solely about what makes money today—it requires exploration of potential for tomorrow. Creative community brings:
- Innovation and experimentation
- Fresh perspectives and use cases
- Organic content and enthusiasm
- Pipeline of developers who may later use Elixir professionally

**Not Core Team Burden:** This isn't about building new creative tooling—it's about visibility and evangelism of what creative people are already doing with Elixir.

## Messaging and Positioning Strategy

### Current State Analysis

**Existing Messaging Characteristics:**
- Factual rather than aspirational
- Assumes audience understanding of OTP and distributed systems challenges
- Focused on technical capabilities rather than emotional resonance
- Most effective with senior developers who have already experienced the problems Elixir solves

**Fundamental Challenge:**
Elixir's learning curve is high compared to other languages. It's not just syntax—there's an entire application design philosophy (OTP, supervision trees, process-based architecture) that is part of the learning curve. Developers who don't embrace this philosophy tend not to see Elixir's benefits and view the additional complexity as unnecessary.

### Target Audience Gap

**Current Success:** Senior developers who "get it" because they've been burned by concurrency issues, deployment nightmares, scaling problems, and brittle systems

**Missing Audience:** Developers who haven't hit those walls yet—they see OTP as unnecessary complexity rather than preventative architecture

**The Need:** Aspirational, forward-looking messaging that says "you will encounter these problems, and when you do, you'll wish you had built with this foundation from the start"

### Messaging Principles for External Conferences

When speaking at conferences in competitive technology spaces:

1. **Honest and Friendly:** No overselling, no deflection of valid criticism
2. **Lead with Strengths:** Focus on what Elixir does exceptionally well
3. **Acknowledge Limitations:** When Elixir isn't a good fit, say so honestly
4. **Address the Room, Not the Heckler:** Win over the persuadable majority rather than arguing with every skeptic
5. **Specific Contrasts:** Attack known weak points of competing tech without being aggressive—make factual comparisons
6. **Meet Them Where They Are:** Use their mental models and pain points as starting point

### Emotional Resonance and Vision

**Gap Identified:** Elixir needs a mission, a vision, a grand ideological purpose. What is the movement? Why does Elixir exist? How do you capture hearts and minds rather than just describing technical capabilities?

**Status:** Vision and mission work is recognized as necessary but not yet defined. This will require time to develop and determination of who has the authority and authenticity to define "the movement."

**Impact:** Until this is resolved, the Adoption Group can execute tactical initiatives (conferences, workshops, case studies) but may be limited in shifting messaging from factual to truly aspirational.

### Order-of-Magnitude Value Communication

The strategy must clearly articulate where Elixir provides transformational rather than incremental value:

- **Not:** "Elixir is better at concurrency"
- **Instead:** "Elixir lets you handle 10x the concurrent connections on the same hardware"

- **Not:** "Elixir has good fault tolerance"
- **Instead:** "Elixir applications self-heal from crashes automatically—no manual restarts, no pager duty at 3am"

Specific, measurable, dramatic claims backed by evidence and case studies.

### Optics and Presentation Quality

**Principle:** We are not overselling Elixir's capabilities—we are bringing presentation quality up to match the substance.

**Current Problem:** Vastly underselling the technology through poor optics, outdated design, low production values

**Areas of Focus:**
- Modern, beautiful website design for Elixir and Phoenix (set tone for ecosystem)
- High-quality AV for podcast and video appearances
- Professional conference presentation materials
- Compelling visual communication of technical concepts
- ElixirConf attendance and energy demonstrating ecosystem health

**Philosophy:** Removing unnecessary friction (poor design, bad audio) that causes dismissal before technical evaluation even begins

---

## Operational Framework

### Funding Model

**Primary Source:** EEF/Elixir Foundation (potentially operating as "Elixir Foundation" DBA under EEF to avoid organizational conflict while maintaining discoverability)

**Requirements:**
- Establish specific budgets for initiative categories
- Set fundraising goals and campaigns
- Create transparent allocation and reporting processes

**Major Expense Categories:**
- Travel and logistics for external conference speakers (Champions and key speakers)
- Case study development and distribution
- Survey administration and analysis
- Workshop coordination and materials
- Competitive analysis research and content creation
- Meetup support materials

**Revenue for ElixirConf:** Ticket sales, sponsorships, speaker-driven ticket sales through compensation program

### Coordination Mechanisms

To be defined during formation, but likely includes:
- Regular meetings or communication cadence
- Shared documentation and planning systems
- Clear request and approval processes for funding
- Reporting structure for transparency to community and funders
- Collaboration channels with core teams, conference organizers, meetup leaders

### Relationship with Existing Institutions

**Elixir Core Team:**
- Autonomous in all technical and documentation decisions
- Provides technical review for Champion content (case-by-case)
- Key speakers (José) participate voluntarily with proper support
- Can accept or reject Adoption Group suggestions on messaging and positioning

**Phoenix Core Team:**
- Autonomous in all technical decisions
- Key speakers (Chris) participate voluntarily with proper support
- Can accept or reject Adoption Group suggestions

**ElixirConf LLC:**
- Operates independently with full control of event
- Adoption Group provides recommendations only
- Can choose level of engagement with Adoption Group suggestions

**Community Platforms (Slack, Discord, Reddit, Forums):**
- Independent moderation and management
- Adoption Group coordinates promotion but doesn't control platforms
- Meetup organizers operate autonomously with optional Adoption Group support

**Library and Framework Authors:**
- Complete autonomy in their projects
- Adoption Group only supports authors who are self-motivated to evangelize their work
- Can opt in to Adoption Group opportunities (conference slots, promotion)

### Geographic Scope

**Primary Focus:** United States and North America initially, based on ElixirConf recommendations and conference targeting

**International Consideration:** Strategy principles apply globally, but specific tactical execution (conference selection, timing, etc.) may need regional adaptation

**Question for Future Resolution:** Should Adoption Group coordinate internationally from inception, or start US-focused with expectation other regions develop parallel efforts?

### Volunteer-Run Model

**Implications:**
- Limited bandwidth requires strategic prioritization
- Depends on sustained commitment from volunteers
- May need to scale to paid positions as funding grows
- Quality and consistency depend on volunteer capability and availability

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Clear scope boundaries prevent overextension
- Annual review allows strategy adjustment if volunteer capacity insufficient
- Focus on coordination/facilitation rather than operational execution
- Reusable content and systems reduce ongoing effort

---

## Success Metrics and Evaluation

---

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Willing Participation from Key People

The entire strategy depends on voluntary participation from:
- José Valim and core Elixir team
- Chris McCord and Phoenix team
- Library and framework authors
- Champions and community speakers
- Companies willing to share success stories

**Without their buy-in, compensated participation, and sustained commitment, the strategy cannot execute.**

### 2. Adequate Funding

Travel, logistics, workshops, content development, and survey administration require substantial budget. Fundraising success through EEF/Elixir Foundation is essential.

### 3. Volunteer Sustainability

As a volunteer-run organization, the Adoption Group requires sustained commitment from capable individuals. Burnout, life changes, or declining interest could derail initiatives.

### 4. Community Trust and Support

The Adoption Group must maintain credibility and trust within the community. Missteps, poor judgment, or perceived overreach could undermine effectiveness and participation.

### 5. Vision Clarity

Until the emotional resonance / aspirational messaging question is resolved, the strategy operates at tactical level only. True strategic shift requires clear, authentic vision from recognized leaders.

### 6. Patience and Long-Term Commitment

Many initiatives (corporate outreach, meetup revival, Champions development) require years to show results. Short-term thinking or premature abandonment due to slow initial progress would be counterproductive.

---

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

## Conclusion

Elixir possesses significant technical advantages but faces adoption challenges that cannot be solved through technology improvements alone. Growing beyond the existing community requires strategic marketing, coordinated outreach, improved presentation, and messaging that resonates with developers who haven't yet experienced the problems Elixir solves.

The Adoption Group provides a framework for coordinating these efforts without centralizing control or undermining the autonomy that makes open source communities effective. By facilitating willing participation, removing barriers, providing resources, and measuring progress, this strategy creates pathways for sustainable growth.

Success requires patience, adequate funding, sustained volunteer commitment, and most importantly, buy-in from the key people who make Elixir what it is. This proposal is not a mandate but an invitation to collaborate on expanding Elixir's reach and impact.

**The question before the community: Is this the right approach, and are we willing to commit the resources and effort to make it happen?**
