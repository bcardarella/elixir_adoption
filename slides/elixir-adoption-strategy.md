# Elixir Adoption Strategy

**A Comprehensive Plan for Growing the Elixir Ecosystem**

---

## Executive Summary

Elixir faces a critical adoption challenge:
- Current messaging is **factual** rather than **aspirational**
- Outreach confined to existing echo chamber
- Losing developers at top of funnel due to presentation issues

**Solution:** Establish an Elixir Adoption Group to coordinate comprehensive adoption initiatives

---

## The Core Challenge

**Elixir requires high learning curve:**
- Not just syntax—entire application design philosophy
- OTP, supervision trees, process-based architecture
- Developers without relevant experience see this as "unnecessary complexity"

**Current success:** Senior developers who've experienced the problems Elixir solves

**Missing audience:** Developers who haven't hit those walls yet

---

## Key Goals

1. Expand reach beyond echo chamber into competitive spaces
2. Develop aspirational messaging that resonates emotionally
3. Improve optics and presentation to compete for attention
4. Build systematic pathways for adoption and retention
5. **Win at least one FAANG/Fortune 500 company within 5 years**

# The Adoption Group

---

## Purpose and Scope

**Strategic coordinator and facilitator** for Elixir adoption initiatives

**Key Principle:** Advisory only—no enforcement authority
- Project owners maintain autonomy
- Conference organizers control their events
- All participation is voluntary

---

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Identify Opportunities** - Research high-impact conferences, corporate targets, library gaps
2. **Facilitate Connections** - Coordinate between core team, speakers, organizers
3. **Provide Resources** - Funding, logistics, reusable content
4. **Gather Intelligence** - Surveys, postmortems, competitive analysis
5. **Package Success Stories** - Case studies and multi-channel distribution
6. **Define Metrics** - Establish KPIs and annual evaluation

---

## Operational Structure

**Staffing:** Volunteer-run initially
**Funding:** Through EEF/Elixir Foundation
**Review:** Annual evaluation of effectiveness
**Authority:** Advisory only

**What the Adoption Group Does NOT Do:**
- Develop language features or tooling
- Manage documentation
- Run conferences
- Build libraries
- Provide ongoing community support

---

# Strategic Initiatives

---

## 1. External Conference Outreach

**Go where they are, not where we are**

Target competitive spaces:
- ReactConf for LiveView
- Python ML conferences for Nx
- Embedded C conferences for Nerves

**Approach:** Honest, friendly, lead with strengths, acknowledge limitations

---

## Conference Strategy: Speaker Tiers

**Tier 1 - Key Speakers**
José (Elixir), Chris (Phoenix/LiveView) - highest impact only

**Tier 2 - Champions**
Selected community members with 1-year terms

**Tier 3 - Community Leaders**
Regional and local events

**Support:** 100% travel funding, reusable slide decks, logistics

---

## Target Talk Frequencies

**Quarterly (distributed across all tiers):**
- Elixir
- Phoenix
- LiveView

**Twice yearly:**
- Nerves
- Nx

---

## 2. Elixir Champions Program

**One-year terms with reapplication**
- Selected from applicant pool
- Demonstrated presentation skills
- Coordinate with core team on content
- Can be reselected based on performance

**Benefits:**
- Prevents over-reliance on core maintainers
- Distributes speaking load
- Built-in quality control through term limits

---

## 3. ElixirConf Optimization

**2025 Goal: 500 attendees** (up from <300 in 2024)

**Recommendations:**
- **Timing:** Move from summer to Nov/Feb/Apr
- **Location:** Mid-west US (e.g., Salt Lake City)
- **Pricing:** ≤$300 workshops, ≤$500 attendees
- **Promotion:** Multi-channel (Reddit, Discord, LinkedIn, etc.)
- **Timeline:** Tickets 6mo advance, schedule 1.5mo before

---

## ElixirConf Speaker Compensation

**Keynote Speakers:** Standard compensation, costs covered

**Regular Speakers:** Opt-in ticket-sales incentive
- Unique speaker code
- Tiered rewards: X tickets = room, X more = flight, X more = revenue share
- Quality control through future selection

**Note:** ElixirConf operates independently—recommendations only

---

## 4. Educational Workshops

**Target:** Once per quarter minimum

**Key Challenge:** Making Elixir approachable for junior developers

**Strategic Question:**
How to teach OTP to developers who haven't experienced the problems it solves?

Create aspirational messaging: *"You will encounter these problems"*

---

## 5. Corporate Outreach

**Target:** FAANG and Fortune 500 companies

**Approach:**
- Offer internal technology talks
- Long-term relationship building
- Understand pain points, address blockers
- Patient, consultative approach

**5-Year Goal:** Win over one major company

Even a single team/division = significant success

---

## 6. Retention & Postmortems

**When companies stop using Elixir:**
- Reach out for opt-in postmortem conversation
- Identify reasons for leaving
- What Elixir lost out to
- Addressable gaps or concerns

**Key Questions:**
- Are we speaking past people by assuming OTP knowledge?
- Are concepts too abstract?
- What practical barriers drove the decision?

---

## 7. Library Ecosystem Gap Analysis

**Process:**
- Gather data from surveys, postmortems, feedback
- Document gaps and pain points
- **Report findings publicly**

**Community decides** whether to build solutions

**Important:** Won't support unmotivated library authors
- Authors must evangelize their own work
- Adoption Group provides support, not demand generation

---

## Design Matters

**Current problem:** Elixir behind on modern, beautiful design

Many adopters lost at top of funnel due to:
- Ugly or outdated-looking sites
- Poor visual presentation

**Elixir and Phoenix should set the tone** for the ecosystem

---

## 8. Meetup Revival

**Challenge:** Many meetups dormant with inactive organizers

**Approach:**
- Simple check-in: "Still interested?"
- Facilitate transfer or co-organizer addition
- Find new organizers from local community

**Support Provided:**
- Monthly content updates
- Reusable slide decks on Elixir changes
- Organizer collaboration venue

---

## Strategic Importance of Meetups

**"Secret weapon" for grassroots growth**

Local meetups → Regional conferences → ElixirConf

Essential community infrastructure

---

## 9. Tech Influencer Coordination

**Coordinate appearances** on podcasts, YouTube, Twitch
- Only with explicit speaker approval
- Connect influencers with core team and Champions

**Critical:** **Optics matter**
- Video quality, audio quality, presentation
- Competition for attention
- Poor AV = lost audience before content

**Support:** Equipment guidance, not direct funding

---

## 10. Case Study Development

**Current Challenge:** Companies don't publicly talk about Elixir usage
- Cultural issue
- Lack of incentive

**For Willing Companies:**
- Adoption Group conducts interviews
- Packages case studies
- Multi-channel distribution (website, white papers, industry publications)

---

## 11. Annual Community Survey

**Current Gap:** No consistent, owned survey

**Purpose:**
- Establish baseline metrics
- Track year-over-year progress
- Define and measure KPIs

**Uses:**
- Strategic planning
- Library gap identification
- PR/marketing material
- Fundraising evidence

---

## 12. Competitive Analysis

**Core Principle:**
For deeply embedded technologies, Elixir must be **dramatically better**, not just "better"

**Strategy:**
- Identify where competitors are weakest vs Elixir strengths
- Create focused comparison write-ups
- Highlight order-of-magnitude advantages

---

## Diverse Value Propositions

Don't position Elixir as only scalability solution

**Different audiences need different benefits:**
- Concurrency/scalability vs Node.js
- Real-time capabilities vs React
- Fault tolerance/self-healing vs most ecosystems
- ML performance vs Python
- Embedded systems vs C

---

## 13. Creative & Hobbyist Community

**Current Gap:** Missing the "weirdos"
- People building fun projects with no ROI
- Tinkerers, creatives, experimenters

**Strategy:**
- Showcase weird, fun, non-commercial projects
- Demonstrate unique capabilities
- Communicate: "Look at the cool things possible with Elixir"

**Importance:** Ecosystem growth needs exploration, not just enterprise use

# Messaging & Positioning

---

## Current State

**Existing messaging:**
- Factual rather than aspirational
- Assumes OTP and distributed systems understanding
- Technical capabilities over emotional resonance
- Works for senior devs who've experienced the problems

**Missing:** Forward-looking messaging for developers who haven't hit the walls yet

---

## Messaging Principles

**For External Conferences:**

1. **Honest and Friendly** - No overselling
2. **Lead with Strengths** - Focus on what Elixir does exceptionally
3. **Acknowledge Limitations** - Be honest about poor fit scenarios
4. **Address the Room** - Win the persuadable majority
5. **Specific Contrasts** - Factual comparisons without aggression
6. **Meet Them Where They Are** - Use their mental models

---

## Emotional Resonance

**Vision Question:** What is the movement?
- Why does Elixir exist?
- What is the grand ideological purpose?
- How to capture hearts and minds?

**Status:** Recognized as necessary, not yet defined
**Impact:** Limits aspirational messaging until resolved

---

## Order-of-Magnitude Communication

**Not:** "Elixir is better at concurrency"
**Instead:** "10x concurrent connections on same hardware"

**Not:** "Good fault tolerance"
**Instead:** "Self-healing applications—no manual restarts, no 3am pages"

**Specific, measurable, dramatic** claims backed by evidence

---

## Optics and Presentation

**Not overselling—bringing presentation quality up to match substance**

**Current Problem:** Underselling through:
- Outdated design
- Poor production values
- Low-energy conferences

**Focus Areas:**
- Modern website design
- High-quality AV
- Professional materials
- ElixirConf energy and attendance
